I have used Nodejs for this project to run our server we need nodejs. Here is the link to download Nodejs  https://nodejs.org/en/
Start your terminal in your favorite editor (ex: vscode) to install Modules just follow me.
1. npm i       //you will get package-lock.json  installed.
2. npm install xmlhttprequest  //installing xmlhttprequest
3. node serve.js   //starting my server (node filename.js)

It's done.  I really be thankfull to deepLogicTech for giving such an exciting project which taught me new things while developing this project. looking forward to learn...
